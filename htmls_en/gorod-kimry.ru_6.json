Here, I would like to make a clearer comment and to answer all current and future questions on this subject.</p><p>On the simple question, &amp;quot; Is it necessary for the Lord &amp;apos; s baptism to fall into the ice? &amp;quot; , I can give the same simple and exhaustive answer: &amp;quot; No, you don't need to &amp;quot; . It's not safe and makes no sense. Does this tradition have something to do with spiritual life? No, it doesn't. It is simply a tradition taken from regions where water in water bodies is now slightly warmer than in our latitudes.
